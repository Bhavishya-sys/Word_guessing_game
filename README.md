Overview

The Word Guessing Game is a fun Python project where the player tries to guess a randomly selected secret word.
You can choose between three difficulty levels — Easy, Medium, and Hard — each containing words of different complexity.

After every incorrect guess, the game provides a hint showing which letters are correct in their positions and which are not (represented by underscores _).

🧠 How It Works

The player chooses a difficulty level: easy, medium, or hard.

A random word from that level’s list is selected as the secret word.

The player repeatedly enters guesses.

For each incorrect guess:

The game shows a hint with correct letters revealed.

When the player guesses correctly, the game displays how many attempts it took.
